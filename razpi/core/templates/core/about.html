                        Democratising technology – providing access to tools – has been our motivation since the Raspberry Pi project began. By driving down the cost of general-purpose computing to below $5, 
                        we’ve opened up the ability for anybody to use computers in projects that used to require prohibitive amounts of capital. Today, with barriers to entry being removed, we see Raspberry 
                        Pi computers being used everywhere from interactive museum exhibits and schools to national postal sorting offices and government call centres. Kitchen table businesses all over the world have been able to scale and find success in a way that just wasn’t possible in a world where integrating technology meant spending large sums on laptops and PCs.

                            Through our charity, the Raspberry Pi Foundation, we engage millions of young people around the world in learning computing and digital making skills through a thriving network of clubs
                             and events, and through partnerships with youth organisations. We enable any school to offer students the opportunity to study computing and computer science through providing the best 
                             possible curriculum, resources, and training for teachers. We work to deepen our understanding of how young people learn about computing and digital making, and to use that knowledge 
                             to increase the impact of our own work and to advance the field of computing education.
